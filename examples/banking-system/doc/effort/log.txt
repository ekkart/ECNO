Banking System: Log of activities and efforts
=============================================

This is a log of all activities done for developing the Banking System example,
concerning the models themselves, but also the needed extensions for the
ECNO tool for generating tests etc.

26. May 2015:

  * Creating the structural models (class diagrams) -- first on paper,
    then as Ecore models (using the Ecore diagram editor):
      134min: 14:13 -- 16:27 (with minor breaks)
      
    Note: the Ecore model was slightly changed when making the the ECNO
          models later
          
  * Creating the behaviour models (ECNO nets and coordination diagrams,
    along side -- directly in the ECNO tool):
      244min: 17:00 -- 21:04 (with minor breaks)
      
  * Generating the code: Creating genmodels and using code generators
      - EMF model:
          2min: 21:04 -- 21:06
      
      - ECNO model:
         11min: 21:06 -- 21:17
      
      - Fixing syntax errors in ECNO Nets (due to missing IDE integration)
        and iterative regeneration of code from ECNO models:
         13min: 21:13 -- 21:30

      - Setting up an instance (most time was consumed by adjusting the
        Ecore model so that the Setting could actually contain the objects
        from the setting); then setting up the configuration and generated code:
         60min: ca. 21:30 -- 22:30

      - Fixing the model (the modelled functionality works properly -- standard
        GUI only) and regeneration; the typical errors where forgotten parameters
        and forgotten coordination annotations:
         22min: ca. 22:30 -- 22:52
         40min: ca. 23:20 -- 24:00
   ------------------------------------------
    526min (8h 46min): First working version (SVN revision 2437)
    

26. May 2015:

  * Extend the models by additional functionality (withdraw money):
      141min: 12:26 -- 14:47
      
  * Regenerating code and fixing syntax errors in the model:
      - EMF part:
           2min: 15:22 -- 15:24
      - ECNO part (ECNO Nets):
          74min: 15:24 -- 16:38 (looking for a supid mistake for almost an hour: accidentally using
                            non-name parameter assignment in event binding; I should switch
                            off this compatibility mode eventually to avoid this problem).

  * Extending the setting (adding bank notes to the ATM and increase the balance of the account) and
    checking behavioural correctness of model (working now). Also here the most time consuming issues
    were minor (but hard to spot) syntax errors in ECNO nets. Also here I should not be gracious
    with incorrect event bindings (which will generate empty code).
       57min: 16:41 -- 17:38
   ------------------------------------------
    274min (4h 34min): Added working withdraw function (SVN revision 2439)       
       
  * Extending version with balance feature:
      - ECNO model
           40min: 19:59 -- 20:39 
            1min: 20:39 -- 20:40 (regeneration and syntactical bug fixing)
            
      - Testing (only one minor change required: forgot to make balance event a GUI event)
            4min: 20:40 -- 20:44
   ------------------------------------------
     45min (0h 45min): Added working balance function (SVN revision 2440)
     
   ======================================================================================     
    845min (14h 5min): First version with full functionality for authentication, balance, and withdraw
